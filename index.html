            <p class="article-paragraph"> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant 
                young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a 
                year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
                venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles 
               that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might 
               have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course 
               of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
               causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens 
               look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. 
               The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles 
               were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of 
               the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they 
               had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
               known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href='#'>the first 
                sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers 
                led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected 
                ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href='#'>gravitational waves</a> — the signature 
                of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a 
                trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun
                evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, 
                including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable 
                to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of 
                time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in 
                 a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
                 Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph"><strong>'As big as it gets'</strong></p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and
                 yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to 
                Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns
                 in a bath of microwave radiation that 
                permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 
                380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known
                 as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic 
                Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at 
                the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a 
                set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
